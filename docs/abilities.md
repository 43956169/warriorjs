Abilities are skills possessed by units.

When you first start, your warrior will only have a few abilities, but with each
level you'll learn new things or find artifacts that'll expand your
capabilities.

There are two kinds of abilities: **actions** and **senses**.

## Actions

An action is an ability that affects the game in some way.

**Only one action can be performed per turn**, so choose wisely.

## Senses

A sense, on the contrary, doesn't affect the game but gathers information about
the floor. You can perform senses as often as you want per turn to collect
information about your surroundings and to aid you in choosing the best action
according to the circumstances.

> Since what you sense will change each turn, you may want to record the
> information you gather for use on the next turn. For example, you can
> determine if you are being attacked if your health has gone down since the
> last turn.
