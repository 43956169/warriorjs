title: Units
---

Units are what populate the floor of each level. Your warrior is one of them but
there are others. Whereas some might be friendly (like captives), the vast
majority will be enemies.

A unit has three main attributes: a name, a character that represents it in the
floor map, and a max health, which is the total damage the unit may take before
dying. It can also be bound, which means its movement is restricted.
