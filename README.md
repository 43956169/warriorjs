This game was originally designed and developed by Ryan Bates to teach the Ruby language. Special thanks to him for the original [ruby-warrior](https://github.com/ryanb/ruby-warrior).

# WarriorJS

This is a game designed to teach JavaScript and artificial intelligence in a fun, interactive way.

You play as a warrior climbing a tall tower to reach the princess at the top level. On each floor, you need to write JavaScript to instruct the warrior to battle enemies, rescue captives, and reach the stairs. You have some idea of what each floor contains, but you never know for certain what will happen. You must give the Warrior enough artificial intelligence up-front to find his own way.

Information on advanced topics of the game can be found in the [WarriorJS wiki](https://github.com/olistic/warriorjs/wiki).

## Installation

The simplest way to install WarriorJS is to use [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com):

```bash
$ npm install -g warriorjs
```

## Usage

WarriorJS is run from the command line.

```bash
$ warriorjs
```

That's it! This will create a warriorjs directory in your current location, where you will find a Player.js file among other things.

## Contributing

WarriorJS is still a work in progress. Pull-requests and ideas are always welcome, as long as they align with the coding-style and direction of the project.
